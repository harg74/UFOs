# UFOs Sightings

## Overview

Are we alone? There has been a lot of UFO sightings accross the US. In order to present them them in a persuasive and in a beautiful way, we created a web app that includes a dynamic table that providing the user with several details related to these encounters.

The tools used to build this web app were: ```JavasScript```, ```HTML``` and ```Bootstrap```.

### Results

To begin with, several input texts were created, so the users can narrow or expand the searches in which they are interested in. They can select a Date, City, Date... Once the options are typed in within the text inputs, thanks to an *event listener*, the table is updated with those selections made by the user, just as shown in the image below.

### Summary

We could modify to have a separte button to refresh the webpage and the selections made by the users remains intact, instead of returning the values as if nothing was selected.

1. First recomendation, in the Enter Date input text, I woud select an option to display a minicalendar that allows clik on a desired date.
2. Second recommendation, in the remaining input texts I would select an option that displays as a dropdown, for example,  different cities, states or shapes of the seen objects. This is because you don't know before hand the available options you can select.
